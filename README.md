<h1>Skinnly</h1>
<p>Welcome to Skinnly, a website that helps consumers with skincare. It is so important to always take care of one's skin, but often many forget or dont know how to do it. With Skinnly, consumers can find out through reviews if the a certain product is good or not, with a list of ingredients to provide users with rounded knowledge about the product they are looking for. <br>
Another thing Skinnly does is Giveaways, where we collobrate with some of this industry's biggeest brands to arrange for a small hand full of lucky consumers to try and test out newly launched products!</p>

<h2>Design Process</h2>
<p>Skinnly is meant to be simplistic and non-overbearing to the eyes thus, our colours are pastals themed and lightly washed colours. The overall feel of the webiste is meant to give users a easy time to navigate through it so we try not to include things that only fulfill as aesthetically and not functionally. <br>
The layout of the website is just typical and similar to all other websites with a navigaton bar at the top and contents filling up the remaining space.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>HOME page: Current giveaways to choose from to apply for. Product split by catergories for user to choose a specific group of products to look at. Top reviews of the week with most upvotes, likes or views in general will be available for all users to see too.<br>
